'''Falconer''' is a [[village]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The [[population]] was 2,540 at the 2000 [[census]].

== History ==
The town was originally called Worksburg, after Edward Work, who purchased the land from the Holland Land Company in August, 1807. The first Falconer to own the land was Robert Falconer, who bought it from Edward Work in 1836. His son, Patrick, later consolidated his land holdings in the future Falconer, New York. The village was later named after William T. Falconer (1850–1915), or his father, Patrick. The town's name was changed to Falconer in 1874. Patrick Falconer, who was on the Board of Directors of the Allegheny &amp; Pittsburg Railroad, donated a large tract of the land through town to the railroad concern. This resulted in the railroad line being routed through the middle of town.[http://www.fancherchair.com/history.htm].

==History==

The area which is now Fredonia was most likely first occupied by early Mound Builders, then the Eries (13th to 17th centuries), then the Iroquois and Senecas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel D. 1997, p. 26&quot;&gt;Daniel D., Architecture in Fredonia, New York, 1811-1997, p. 26, White Pine Press (1997) (ISBN 1-877727-86-5)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, Robert Morris purchased the Fredonia land from Massachusetts and sold it to the Holland Land Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel D. 1997, p. 26&quot;/&gt; Parcels were sold to pioneers around 1800, and the first settlers came around 1803 or 1804.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel D. 1997, p. 26&quot;/&gt;

In 1821, William Hart dug the first well specifically to produce natural gas in the United States in the Village of Fredonia on the banks of Canadaway Creek in Chautauqua County, New York. It was 27 feet deep, excavated with shovels by hand, and its gas pipeline was hollowed out logs sealed with tar and rags&lt;ref&gt;http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/energy_in_brief/print_pages/natural_gas_production.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. It supplied enough [[natural gas]] for lights in two stores, two shops and a grist mill (currently the village's Fire Station) by 1825. Expanding on Hart's work, the [[Fredonia Gas Light Company]] was eventually formed in 1858, becoming the first American natural gas company. The site of the first gas well is marked by a stone monument in downtown Fredonia.

The Village of Fredonia was incorporated in 1829. The original name for the area was Canadaway (from the Indian word ''Ganadawao'', meaning ''among the hemlocks''). The name &quot;Fredonia&quot; was coined by [[Samuel Latham Mitchill]], coupling the English word &quot;freedom&quot; with a Latin ending.  He proposed it as a replacement name for the [[United States]].  It failed in that regard, but became the name of many towns and cities (Stewart, pg. 173).

Established within 20 years of the founding of the Village of Fredonia, the [[Fredonia Academy]] was the first higher educational institution in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]].  It was started in 1824, and opened in 1826.  The Academy became a [[State Normal School]] in 1866.  On August 8, 1867, a long-awaited event took place when the cornerstone of the Fredonia Normal School was laid on a site where the [[Old Main building]] stands today. The Normal School used the Academy's building, which stood on the site of the present [[Village Hall]], until the Old Normal was completed in 1868.  The Fredonia Normal School is now One Temple Square and Association, a 91-unit, NY hud housing project for the disabled and the elderly that was started by Henry F. Sysol, Jr. in (1978) 1980.  Thereafter the Academy building was used for some time as Fire Department Headquarters.  Today the building houses the Village offices and includes the 1891 [[Fredonia Opera House]], a former Vaudeville theater that fell into disrepair in the 1970s while being operated as a movie house.  The Theater underwent a complete nine-year restoration in the 1980s by the Fredonia Preservation Society and a cadre of volunteers.  It now serves as a year-round performing arts center.  In 1930 under the director of the Normal School, [[Hermann Cooper]], {{convert|58|acre|m2}} of land west of Central Avenue were bought with the dream that one day it would become a campus. The construction of a music building took place in 1939 and in 1942 the [[Feinberg Law]] converted the Normal School into a [[Teachers College]]. In 1948 the college became a vital part of the new State University of New York [[State University of New York|SUNY]] system.

In the mid-19th century Fredonia became the home of the first dues-paying [[The Grange (organization)|Grange]]. The [[United States]]' first Grange Hall was erected in Fredonia during the late 1860s (the Fredonia Grange was established on April 16, 1868), and the original building (Grange Hall #1) still stands on Main Street. Fredonia was also host to the first meeting of the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], which was held at the Fredonia Baptist Church in 1873.

During the Olympic Torch's trip in the 1996 Atlanta Summer games, sixth grade teacher, Kate Leary, from Fredonia Middle School carried the torch as it went through the town on US Route 20.

The Fredonia State campus was the location of training camps for two major professional sports teams: The [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[NFL]], and the [[Buffalo Braves]] of the [[NBA]].  The Braves relocated to San Diego (as the re-named [[San Diego Clippers]]) in 1978, and the Bills moved their training camp in 2000 to [[St. John Fisher College]] near [[Rochester, Monroe County, New York|Rochester, New York]].

[[Samuel L. Clemens]], better known as [[Mark Twain]] had connections to Fredonia, via relatives.

'''Jamestown''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], [[New York]] in the [[United States]]. The population was 31,730 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]].{{GR|2}}

The '''City of Jamestown''' is adjacent to [[Ellicott, New York|Town of Ellicott]] and is at the southern tip of [[Chautauqua Lake]]. The town of [[Chautauqua, New York|Chautauqua]], home of the [[Chautauqua Institution]], is 17&amp;nbsp;miles (27&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of Jamestown.

The city has been a center for the manufacture of wood products such as furniture as well as a major producer of mattresses. The town was once called the &quot;Furniture Capital of the World.&quot; Although many of these industries have migrated away from the area in recent times, Jamestown still retains a few large manufacturing plants for various multinational corporations. The city has a large concentration of citizens of Swedish and Italian ancestry.

Jamestown is noted as the birthplace of actress and comedienne [[Lucille Ball]], as well as the fictitious childhood hometown of [[Lucy Ricardo]], her character on the popular [[U.S.]] [[television]] [[sitcom]] ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' ([[CBS]], 1951–1960). Jamestown houses the Lucille Ball Museum and festival twice yearly, once in May and once in August. Other notable famous residents of Jamestown include Roger Tory Peterson, and the institute named after him as well as Supreme Court Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], of Nuremburg trial fame.  Singer [[Natalie Merchant]] with Steve Gustafson, and the band Ten Thousand Maniacs also originated in Jamestown.  The Maniacs gold and platinum records hang on the wall of Jamestown City Hall.

===Sports===

This is the home city for the [[Jamestown Jammers]] [[baseball]] team of the [[New York - Penn League]].  The Jammers are the Single A Short Season affiliate of the [[Florida Marlins]].

Jamestown was also home to the now-defunct [[Jamestown Vikings]] of the short-lived [[Mid-Atlantic Hockey League]] between 2007 and 2008. Currently, the city houses the headquarters of the [[Northern Junior Hockey League]], which includes a local team, the [[Jamestown Jets]]. The Jets, like several other NJHL members, split off from the [[United Junior Hockey League]] during the 2009 offseason.

Jamestown High School's boys and girls basketball teams have both won numerous Sectional and Division titles. The High School Football team has been to four New York State Championships, losing in 1993, and winning in 1994, 1995, and 2000

Jamestown hosted its 14th Babe Ruth World Series in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestownworldseries.com World Series Central]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamestown will host, at the [[Jamestown Savings Bank Ice Arena]], three exhibition games prior to the start of the [[2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].

==Major employers==
The Jamestown area has a few large manufacturing plants that are major employers in this region. These include ''Bush Industries'' (makers of ready-to-assemble furniture), &quot;Crawford Furniture&quot; (makers of solid wood furniture) ''Cummins Inc.'' (manufacturer of diesel engines; the heavy duty engine plant is located in the [[Busti, New York|Town of Busti]], just west of Jamestown, but still called the Jamestown Engine Plant or JEP), ''SKF AeroEngine (formerly MRC Bearings)'', ''TitanX'' and ''Truck-Lite'' (makers of truck lighting systems) &quot;Blackstone&quot; (makers of sheet metal).  Chain stores have opened in recent years in the surrounding area, including Walmart, KMart, Wegmans, Sam's Club, CVS, and Rite Aid. The Jamestown area used to have a chain of Grocery stores, &quot;Quality Markets&quot; (aka Bi-Low) , recently bankrupt, have now been bought out by TOPS Friendly Markets. &quot;The Connection&quot; an outsource phone call center has become a major employer on the corner of Second and Washington Streets in Jamestown housed in the Furniture Mart building, and headquarterd out of MN. http://www.the-connection.com/about_locations.html  Jamestown is the home of hot dog franchise &quot;Johnny's Lunch&quot;, founded in 1936, now expanding into many other states. http://www.johnnyslunch.com/index.php?act=pressrelease   However, many of the places of employment are packing up and leaving at a growing rate. The unemployment rate shows this area to be one of the most economically depressed areas of NY State.  Population decrease and job decrease have gone hand in hand in this area.  Senior Citizens have claimed previous retail buildings in downtown area that have been revamped for senior housing.
WCA Hospital (Women's Christian Association) was founded May 23, 1885, and included a nursing school until Jamestown Community College filled the need with a 2 year RN nursing program.  Though Jamestown General Hospital, still stands in the present day on Jones Hill, it is no longer public, and is now part of WCA, housing mental health units as well as laboratories.  The main campus of Wca is on the corner of Allen St and Foote Avenue.
At present, the greater Jamestown are remains at the center of an impressive agricultural region.  Among the area's leading producers are Welch's, Mogen David, Kraft Foods and Red Wing.  Of all the counties in New York State, Chautauqua County has more farms than any other (about 2,200).  Although its primary agricultural product is milk, Chautauqua County is also the State's greatest producer of wine and jelly grapes.  The area's production of Concord grapes is one of the largest in the nation, second only to California.

==Education==
Jamestown has one campus of [[Jamestown Community College]] which provides a two-year education. [[Jamestown Business College]] now provides a four-year degree in many majors.

Jamestown also houses a high school, [[Jamestown High School (New York)|Jamestown High School]]; three middle schools, Persell Middle School, George Washington Middle School, and Thomas Jefferson Middle School; as well as six elementary schools, C.C. Ring School, CV Bush School, Fletcher School, Abraham Lincoln School, Love School, and Rogers School.

The Red Raider Marching Band from [[Jamestown High School (New York)|Jamestown High School]] is one of the most traveled high school marching bands in the country, having been as far as Hawaii, and appearing on such shows as ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]''. The Marching Band won the NY State Field Band Conference Championship in 1991, and has consistently placed in the top 10 at Bands of America competitions.  They also played at the pregame show at the 2004 [[FedEx]] [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]].  In December 2007 they traveled to [[Florida]] again, to play at the [[Citrus Bowl]]. They will be traveling to New York City for the St. Patricks Day Parade this March.  The other premiere music ensemble at JHS is the A Cappella Choir.  An auditioned ensemble featuring students from grades 10-12, the A Cappella choir has had only 4 directors in their 85 year history, starting with Ebba H. Goranson in 1924, continuing with Donald B. Bube and Brian A. Bogey, all the way to the choir's current director Benjamin P. Bracey.  The A Cappella has traveled and sung internationally at: Saint Michael's Cathedral in Toronto, Canada; Saint Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna, Austria; the Cathedral in Salzburg, Austria that W.A. Mozart served as parish musician; Saint Paul's, Westminster, and Salisbury Cathedrals in England; and the Saint Anne de Beaupre and Notre Dame Basilica in Quebec City, Canada.  In the United States the choir has traveled to Washington, D.C.; Boston Massachusetts; New York City; Walt Disney World, Florida, and Chicago, Illinois.

==Transportation==
===Air===
The [[Chautauqua County-Jamestown Airport]] (JHW) is north of the city and provides scheduled and charter air service.

===Bus===
Bus service is provided by [[Coach USA]] of Erie. Connections are available. to the [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] service in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. There is also a county wide bus service ([[Chautauqua Area Regional Transportation Service|CARTS]]) and taxi service through various companies.

===Rail===
====Long distance railroads====
Present day Jamestown is on the [[mainline (railway)|mainline]] of the [[Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad (2001)|Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad]] which provides freight service. [[Amtrak]] provides a daily [[Thruway Motorcoach]] service between its [[Buffalo-Exchange Street (Amtrak station)|Buffalo-Exchange Street Station]] and Jamestown.

Until the 1970s, four railroad companies travelled through Jamestown:
*[[Erie Railroad]] - main line passing through Jamestown (New York to Chicago)
*[[Pennsylvania Railroad]] - Chatauqua Branch (Oil City to Brocton-Buffalo) at Mayfield
*[[New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad|Nickle Plate Railroad]] - Buffalo-St. Louis
*[[New York Central Railroad]] - (New York–Chicago) at Westfield

In 1976, these railroads (minus the Nickle Plate Railroad) were absorbed into [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]], and then ultimately, by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and [[CSX Transportation]] in 1998.

The Erie Railroad's former [[Erie Railroad Station (Jamestown, New York)|Jamestown Station]] still exists, and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.

====Electric interurban - the Jamestown, Westfield and Northwestern====
An electric [[interurban]] railroad—[[Jamestown, Westfield and Northwestern Railroad]] (JW&amp;NW)—connected all three above towns (Jamestown-Mayfield-Westfield) and ran along the north side of Lake Chatauqua. The JW&amp;NW ended passenger operation in 1947, continued with freight, then quit entirely in 1950. Its rails and right-of-way have slowly disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=J. D. |last=Ingles |title=p. 72S |work=Classic Trains magazine |date=Fall 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed power plant==

Jamestown is the site of a proposed coal-burning power plant, for which [[Praxair|Praxair, Inc.]] is seeking a subsidy from the [[United States Department of Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Praxair to Seek DOE Funding for Oxy-Coal Project | work = Press release| publisher = [[Praxair]]| date = August 21, 2008 | url = http://www.praxair.com/praxair.nsf/AllContent/D213CBF327494D37852574AC005C36EA?OpenDocument| accessdate = 2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant, which would have an estimated cost of over $500 million, has been criticized by environmentalists and area residents.  A study by an environmental consulting firm concluded that the cost of electricity from the proposed plant would be substantially higher than that of existing power sources, and higher than the cost of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[Wind power|wind]] alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Sommer| first = Mark | last2 = Robinson| first2 = David | title = Study is critical of Jamestown ‘clean coal’ plant plans| newspaper = [[The Buffalo News]]| date = September 18, 2009| url = http://www.buffalonews.com/412/story/799361.html#| accessdate = 2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents of the new power plant, including local radio talk show host John Siggins, believe that building the plant will keep Jamestown's history of cheap electricity going. But the majority of Jamestown's residence think otherwise. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

'''Silver Creek''' is a [[village]] located in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].  As of the 2000 census, the village had a total population of 2,896. The village is named after a small river that runs through the village.

The '''Village of Silver Creek''' is on the shore of [[Lake Erie]] and within the [[Hanover, New York|Town of Hanover]].

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
The community was first settled around 1803 and the first school house was erected around 1823.  In 1822, a famous [[Black Walnut|black walnut tree]], measuring about 10 feet in diameter, was blown over in a storm.

The Village of Silver Creek was incorporated in 1848.  It was an important port on Lake Erie until railroads reduced shipping.

Silver Creek is home to a [[skew arch|Skew Arch]] Railroad Bridge, one of few bridges in the country built on an angle.

Silver Creek's most famous resident is [[Howard Ehmke|Howard &quot;Bob&quot; Ehmke]].  He was the pitching hero of the 1929 World Series. While playing for the Philadelphia Athletics, Ehmke struck out 13 Chicago Cubs in Game 1, a World Series record until 1953.

Former NBA and ABA professional basketball player [[George Carter (basketball)|George Carter]] is also a Silver Creek Central graduate. Carter starred at [[St. Bonaventure University]] and later participated in the 1971 ABA All Star Game.

== Geography ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
Silver Creek is located at 42°32'39&quot; North, 79°10'2&quot; West (42.544083, -79.167088){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of 1.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (3.0&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 1.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (3.0&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and none of the area is covered with water.

Silver Creek is part of the Lake Erie Basin.  The two creeks in the village, Silver Creek and Walnut Creek, empty into the lake.

Silver Creek is at the junction [[New York State Route 5|NYS Route 5]] (Central Avenue) and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US Route 20]] (Main Street) and north of the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90]] Exit 58).

Silver Creek is on the New York-to-Chicago Main Line of CSXT and on the New York-Buffalo-Chicago Main Line of the Norfolk Southern Railway.

The CSXT line through Silver Creek was formerly operated by the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), successor to the Penn Central, successor to the New York Central Railroad, successor to the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway, successor to the Lake Shore Railroad, successor to the Buffalo &amp; Erie Railway, the original line.

The Norfolk Southern line through Silver Creek was formerly operated by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, successor to the New York, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate Road [NKP]), the original line.

The Penn Central's (former Pennsylvania Railroad) (PRR) Buffalo-Corry (PA)-Pittsburgh line formerly operated through Silver Creek.  The single-track lines of the NKP and PRR were jointly operated to form a double-track line which was used by trains of both railroads.  The former PRR line was abandoned c. 1976 by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission to promote highway transportation.

From c.1907 to c. 1933 Silver Creek was on the Buffalo-to-Erie Main Line of the Buffalo &amp; Erie Railway (successor to the Buffalo &amp; Lake Erie Traction Company), a high-speed electric interurban railway.  It was abandoned on order of the New York Public Service Commission to promote highway transportation.

== Businesses within the Village of Silver Creek ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
Silver Creek has many businesses within the village limits. They vary from small business to corporate such as those of Quality Markets (The Penn Traffic Company) and Rite Aid (Rite Aid of NY, Inc.)

Silver Creek has hometown favorites like Ellie's Deli and Red's Pizza Express which have become Silver Creek staples. There is also Food King Chinese Restaurant which opened in late 2006 in the space formerly occupied by Jankowski &amp; Co.

Rem-Tronics has been another major employer for Silver Creek.
They are followed by Excelco Developments and Newbrook Machine Corporation.
Another large and well known employer is Petri Baking Products regionally known for their cookies and other baked goods.

For your sign and computer/internet needs there is Hae Jude Signs and Final Communications.
Both are located in the former Millar Lumber Building on Central Ave. between Hanover and Elm Streets.

There are several car dealerships within the area. They are Damon Motors Chrysler Dodge Jeep, Dolce Automotive, and Part Time Automotive. All can provide NY State Safety and Emissions Inspections.

The former J.B's Lamplite building downtown has a lot of history to it.
In 1972, it was constructed after the former Barone's Market was gutted by fire that same year.
Ironically it met the same fate in 2001 after which the original owner decided to sell.
It then became RT Creekers until that closed in late 2006.
The Silver Creek American Legion Post now currently occupies the building.

There is also Uncle Sam's Army-Navy which sells a variety of merchandise pertaining to Military, Law Enforcement, Fire, EMS, and the Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts of America.

Another newer Silver Creek business is The Backline which doubles as both a Teen Nightclub on the weekends and a fitness center during the week. It was formerly the Geitner Theater until it was purchased in 1999 by Karen &amp; Matt Bogosian of Silver Creek.

Update: In December 2009, Damon Motors closed its doors forever after nearly 54 years of service to northern Chautauqua County. Guess its a sign of the times as Chrysler was trimming off the amount of dealerships it operates.

Recently, Quality Markets celebrated its re-grand opening in early June 2010 under the Tops Markets banner. The store remaining open proves how much of an asset it is to the residents of Silver Creek.

== Medical/Law Enforcement/Fire/EMS of the Silver Creek Region ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
Silver Creek is also served by the Lake Erie Regional Health System with Lake Shore Hospital in Irving, Brooks Hospital in Dunkirk, and Tri-County Memorial Hospital in Gowanda.
Its Trauma Facilities are Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, NY and Hamot Medical Center in Erie, PA. In August 2009, a horrific flash flood devastated areas such as Silver Creek, Sunset Bay, and Gowanda.
As a result of the flood, the NY State Dept. of Health closed Tri County Memorial Hospital indefinitely until a new building can be constructed in a different location in Gowanda.
That leaves Brooks Memorial Hospital, WCA Hospital, and Lake Shore Hospital as the remaining facilities to treat patients in this region. The decision to close Tri County came because of the amount of contamination from the onsite lab and the amount of water and/or raw sewage that flooded into the facility.

Silver Creek is also served by a fully staffed village police department with about 15 full and part time employees. The police dept. is also responsible for security during court.
They are assisted by the Chautauqua County Sheriff's Department as well as the NY State Police.

Silver Creek also has a fully staffed volunteer fire department with 50-60 active volunteers and junior firefighters/explorers. They run in conjunction with the Silver Creek Emergency Squad answering your calls for help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
They are trained by both the NY State Office of Fire Prevention &amp; Control as well as the NY State Dept. of Health's Bureau of EMS.
In August 2009, The Emergency Squad building and Village Fire Hall sustained substantial damage when a flash flood occurred on August 9.
The water flooded the Fire Hall basement destroying the air compressor for the old twin diaphone air whistle as well as destroying the Police Dept.'s evidence room. The overhead doors at the fire hall and squad building were destroyed when the pressure of the water pushed them in like tinfoil.
The squad building's glass man door was also shattered by the extreme force of the water.
The garage behind the fire hall which housed several of the village's police cruisers were also damaged. A few automotive victims of the flood were the new S-3, a 2009 Dodge Charger; Ambulance 172, a 1991 Ford E-350/Signal Vehicle Products modular style ambulance; S-1 and the old S-4, two Ford Crown Victorias that were scheduled to be retired from service in the future as Silver Creek Police updated its fleet.
The village public works department on North Main St. was completed destroyed. They lost all major equipment and trucks with the exception of one dump truck.
Their building has since been torn down due to that it was deemed unsafe for entry.
They recently acquired a new building in the old Bentges distributing plant on Routes 5 and 20 in the Town of Hanover.
Besides the damage to the Squad Building, DPW building, and Village Fire Hall, several homes along Walnut Creek were badly damaged or deemed uninhabitable, the Silver Village Trailer Park was completely leveled by the flood waters of Silver Creek itself. Tenants had to be rescued from their trailers by members of Silver Creek Fire, Sunset Bay Fire, Sheridan Fire, Hanover Hose, Irving Fire, and Forestville Fire.
Several village streets were badly damaged or washed away completely by the flood waters.
The local funeral chapel, Hole Parker Funeral Home was damaged very badly by the flood waters.
The owner has since been able to remain in business after a major cleanup effort was made.

The lone catholic church across from the Fire Hall received a lot of damage in the church itself, as well the priest's residence, and the adjoining school building.
During the time of the flood, A command center was being established at Silver Creek High School by the Superintendent of Schools David O'Rourke, Village Mayor Kurt Lindstrom, Fire Chief Todd Johnson, County Emergency Services coordinator Julius Leone, Jr., County Executive Greg Edwards, Village Police Chief Timothy Roche as well officials from the American Red Cross, NY State Dept of Health, Chautauqua County Sheriff Dispatch Office, various battalion coordinators from Chautauqua County and NY State Fire Coordinators and the Fire Police Response Team.
Also the Town and Village Disaster Coordinators.

During the next week following the floods, the clean up began with assistance from the County's 2nd Fire Battalion including Brocton, Chautauqua, Hartfield, Dewittville, Mayville, Portland, Ripley, and Westfield.
They had the job of getting the mud off the roads and sidewalks so traffic could start moving again along US 20 and NY 5. Eventually the command center was moved to Mt. Carmel Catholic School after the facility was thoroughly cleaned. Donations were handed out at the High School and Village Fire Hall before all donations were turned over to be distributed at Mt. Carmel school.

It made everyone a little bit wiser for the wear since it could have been much worse than it was.

Eventually by the end of 2009 and the start of 2010 life for village residents was starting to return to normal. Silver Village has started to rebuild itself. Most of the homes damaged have been repaired. And all roads damaged have since been resurfaced with dirt and asphalt.

Starflight is the County run medevac service controlled by Alstar Ambulance and the Chautauqua County Sheriff's Dept.
Mercy Flight is a non for profit medevac service based out of Buffalo, NY.
Life Star is the medevac service controlled by Emergycare, Hamot Medical Center, and Saint Vincent Health System of Erie, PA.
All 3 service the Silver Creek area.

Andrew Kehrer is the town prosecutor. He works for the office of District Attorney David Foley. He also has his own law office on Main Street.

== Grape Festival ==
{{No footnotes|section|date=June 2010}}
Every September, Silver Creek hosts the Grape Festival.  It began in [http://www.silvercreekny.com/Silver%20Creek%20Time%20Line.htm 1968].
The Grape Festival has a [[parade]] with floats, marching bands, karate demonstrations, dance performances, and old cars and a march by the fire department.  There are also mini-bikeperformances, a talent show for Miss Festival of Grapes, Jr. Miss Festival, Little Miss and Prince of the Festival. There is also a &quot;Grower of the year&quot; Award given to the best grape grower of that year. The winners ride in the parade and compete in the Grape Stomp.

In 2008, the Silver Creek Grape Festival made national television on [[Good Morning America]]. Diane Sawyer, Robin Roberts, Sam Champion and Chris Cuomo visited a farm to stomp grapes for their trip across America during the 2008 election, in which they visited 50 states in 50 days asking about the economy in rural America &lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/5050/&lt;/ref&gt;. Diane Sawyer called it &quot;the first and maybe last annual GMA grape stomping contest in honor of Lucille Ball, who was born 30 minutes from Silver Creek.&quot; The four competed against each other stomping grapes.

The Grape Festival is in honor of Concord grapes.

== School==
{{No footnotes|section|date=June 2010}}
Silver Creek has an exemplary school district. The school has been recognized by [[Business First]] as the number one overachieving school district in Western New York, as shown by a comparison of academic outcomes and socioeconomic conditions for the past two years in a row.

In Silver Creek, all three of the schools are connected to ensure an easier transition into the next stage of learning. The elementary school is attached to the middle school which forms into the [[high school]] and is the end of a student’s grade school education. [http://www.silvercreek.wnyric.org/silvercreek/site/default.asp Website]

Silver Creek also maintains its own transportation department rather than contracting out for school bus service.
In the last 25 years most of the bus drivers have come from all walks of life including some that were retired US Postal Service employees and retired law enforcement officers.
The transportation director is responsible for all 30 buses which include the AM Double Trip pickup for Grades 6-12 starting at 6:40am and Grades Pre-K to 5th as soon as the buses empty of their 6th to 12th grade and out of town school students at about 7:45am.

This system converts to a single trip system for dismissal at 2:15pm for Pre-K to 5th Grade students and 2:20pm for 6th to 12th Grade students.
4 buses are used for a 3:15pm run for those students who stay for extra help, 9th period detention, and afternoon Vo-Tech students returning from LoGuidice Educational Center in Fredonia, NY.

The buses are also used for all school sponsored sporting events that are held at other schools as well as all school sponsored field trips and the annual class night bash for the graduating class for the particular school year.
There 2 runs for Vo-Tech in Fredonia, NY, one staring at 8:05am that drops the students off at LoGuidice Educational Center at about 8:25am. AM Vo-Tech students are released to the bus following attendance taking procedures for Silver Creek and morning announcements.
The afternoon run starts at 11:00am departing from Silver Creek Central and arrives at LoGuidice at about 11:25am. At this time the AM Vo-Tech students are picked up and returned to Silver Creek Central with the bus departing LoGuidice at about 11:40am and arrive back at SCCS at 12:05pm for their afternoon classes at Silver Creek Central.
The same bus departs the bus garage at about 1:45pm to pick up the PM Vo-Tech students at LoGuidice with a departing time of 2:15pm per an agreement with Silver Creek Central Schools and LoGuidice Educational Center due the scheduling of the home school district transporting the students.

In the event that Silver Creek Central is open but LoGuidice is closed either for a snow day or some other reason due that of staff training or power outage, SCCS makes adjustments to fit these students into study halls or the HS library during which time they would ordinarily be at Vo-Tech.

In the event of a snow day or the need for emergency early dismissal, the following are usually contacted:

WKBW-TV 7 ABC Buffalo, NY
WGRZ-TV 2 NBC Buffalo, NY
WIVB-TV 4 CBS/WNLO CW 23 Buffalo, NY

=== School Athletics ===
{{No footnotes|section|date=June 2010}}
At Silver Creek Central School, the athletics are very well supported.[http://cu.westfieldrepublican.com/pages/user_detail.php?user=144557]  The athletic director is Mr. Sean Helmer. Mr. Helmer replaces Mr. Archie Bradley as Athletic Director who recently retired in 2006 after many years of service to the Silver Creek Central School District as a physical education teacher, Dean of students as well as Varsity Football coach until his retirement.  The school colors are black and old gold.  The mascot is the black knight. There are over ten choices of different athletics for girls and boys for every season.  There are modified, junior varsity, and varsity athletics. The 08-09 boys varsity football team made it to [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]], which is just one of the accomplishments made by the athletes of Silver Creek.

The SADD program is also available at Silver Creek High School. It represents for students against destructive decisions. In the past they have had movie nights for younger ages in Elementary school were the children pay for a have a night of movies and food and activities.

The &quot;Town of Newtown&quot; (now [[Elmira (town), New York|Town of Elmira]]) was taken from Chemung in 1792.  Subsequently, Chemung lost more territory to form all or parts of [[Erin, New York|Erin]] (1822), [[Baldwin, New York|Baldwin]] (1856), and [[Ashland, New York|Ashland]] (1867).

The [[Chemung River]] flows through the south part of the town. [[Cayuta Creek]], a tributary of the Chemung River defines part of the east town line.

The south border of the town is [[Pennsylvania]] ([[Bradford County, Pennsylvania|Bradford County]]) and the east border is [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]].

The [[Southern Tier Expressway]] ([[New York State Route 17]]) and [[New York State Route 427]] are east-west highways in Chemung.

== Fire Protection ==

'''HISTORY'''
The Elmira Heights Volunteer Fire Department was founded in 1896. When it began it was composed of two companies, the Chemical and Hose Company and the Independent Hook and Ladder Company. These later combined into one department. The first fire chief was William Monroe and the first fire bell was purchased from Grace Church in Elmira. The original fire station was across the street from its present location on the northeast corner of Scottwood and Fourteenth Street. It was merely a shed in which to store equipment. Throughout the Heights three hose carts were placed. In case of a fire, this was the procedure used: Someone ran to ring the fire bell while everyone else near the fire ran to the hose cart to fasten the hose to the nearest hydrant. When the fire bell rang, firemen from every part of the village raced to the fire station. The hook and ladder truck was hand-drawn. The hose carts and chemical engine were horse-drawn.

Anyone with a team of horses made a bee-line for the station. The first team that appeared to pull the apparatus received three dollars for his services and the second team received two dollars for the use of his team. The race to see what man would get his team to the fire station first was almost as exciting as the fire itself. At the fire, the hose was connected to the hose already connect to the hydrant and the real fire fighting began.

The fire department had its social side as well. The two companies were as separate as it was possible to be. You either belonged to one or the other, but never both. You might walk to the door of the building with your friend of the other company, but once inside the door friendship ceased until you came back out. Benefit dances, card parties, and social gatherings were held and things went fine until it was time to divide the money. This rivalry and animosity continued until one night a new fire chief, tired of the bickering, ordered the door to be opened between the parlors of the two companies.

'''TODAY'''

Today the Elmira Heights Fire Department is located next door to the Elmira Heights [[Village hall|Village Hall]]. It still maintains an all volunteer roster and offers Fire and EMS services to the Village of Elmira Heights, and the Towns of Elmira and Horseheads.

== Police Services ==

'''TODAY'''
The Elmira Heights Police Department is a small agency consisting of a force of ten men which offers 24/7 police protection to the Village of Elmira Heights. The Police Department shares their operations facility with the Elmira Heights Fire Department.

&lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!!!!    : On the official Quarrymen website run by the three surviving original members who are still actively performing - there is a clear distinction drawn between the eight people who played as official members of the band during its 4-year duration (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Pete Shotton, Rod Davis, Colin Hanton, Len Garry, Eric Griffiths) who are described as &quot;members&quot; and several other people who made just a few appearances with the group (most notably Ivan Vaughan, Nigel Walley, Bill Smith, John Duff Lowe, Ken Brown, Stuart Sutcliffe).  The latter 6 are described as friends and honorary members of the band.  This delineation is not always understood by biographers who have written about the Quarrymen 50 years after the band's original incarnation.  We need to defer to the facts stated by the actual founding-members on their official website rather than to opinions expressed in books by writers with no first-hand knowledge - writing about the events 50 years later     --&gt;

&lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!!!!    In the years between 1956 and 1960 when the Quarrymen were initially active - the term in Britain for a musical combo playing skiffle and rock 'n' roll was GROUP not BAND.  Up till then - in the UK the word &quot;band&quot; connoted dance orchestras  and jazz combos.  The word &quot;band&quot; SUBSEQUENTLY came into usage to describe popular music groups in the late 60s when there was a transition from &quot;pop groups&quot; playing &quot;beat music&quot; to &quot;rock bands&quot; playing &quot;rock music.&quot;  This point is addressed on the official Quarrymen website.  See:  http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/myth_10.html   In any event, the Quarrymen in the period 1956-1960 were referred to - and referred to themselves - as a GROUP - and NOT as a &quot;band&quot;   --&gt; 
'''The Quarrymen''' (sometimes erroneously written &quot;Quarry Men&quot;) are a British [[skiffle]] and [[rock 'n' roll]] group, initially formed in [[Liverpool]] in 1956, who evolved over a four-year period into [[The Beatles]], the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed rock band in world history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worldwide sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emigroup.com/NR/exeres/60E71CC3-405A-42F4-A013-1B20496FAE04.htm |title=1960-1969 |publisher=EMI Group Ltd |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080528230300/http://www.emigroup.com/NR/exeres/60E71CC3-405A-42F4-A013-1B20496FAE04.htm |archivedate = May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=1999&amp;resultpage=2&amp;id=3ABF3EC8-EF5B-58F9-E949-3B57F5E313DF |title=The American Recording Industry Announces its Artists of the Century |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) |date=10 November 1999 |accessdate=26 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Immortals: The First Fifty |journal=Rolling Stone |issue=946 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty |accessdate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-artists-20.shtml |title=The Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists (20-01) |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving founder-members of the group reformed the band in 1997 and are still active as of 2010. [http://www.thequarrymen.info/]

Originally consisting of [[John Lennon]] and several schoolfriends, the Quarrymen took their name from a line in the school song of [[Calderstones School|Quarry Bank High School]] which Lennon and most of the other original group members attended.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/myth_8.html&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon's mother, [[Julia Lennon]], taught her son to play the [[banjo]] and then showed Lennon and [[Eric Griffiths]] how to tune their guitars in a similar way to the banjo, and taught them simple chords and songs.

Lennon started a skiffle group that was very briefly called the Blackjacks, but changed the name before any public performances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/myth_9.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts credit Lennon with choosing the new name. Other accounts credit his close friend [[Peter Shotton|Pete Shotton]] with suggesting the name. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before [[Paul McCartney]] joined the band in July 1957. [[George Harrison]]  joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison (still only 14 when he was first introduced to Lennon) to be too young.

The group made an amateur recording of themselves in 1958, performing [[Buddy Holly]]'s &quot;[[That'll Be the Day]]&quot; and &quot;[[In Spite of All the Danger]]&quot; - a song written by McCartney and Harrison. In early 1960, the group started exploring various alternative names. After Lennon recruited his art school pal [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] to the group, they tried the name the Silver Beetles and other variations, before finally settling on [[Beatles]] in August 1960 when they first performed in Hamburg. In 1997 the five surviving original members of the group (all except the deceased Lennon) reunited to perform at the 40th anniversary celebrations of the garden fete performance at which Lennon and McCartney met for the first time.  The band decided to continue playing and since 1998 have performed in many countries throughout the world.  Griffiths died in 2005 and Shotton retired owing to ill-health.  As of 2010, the three active founding-members are still performing as The Quarrymen.

==Early years==
In the mid-1950s, there was a revival in the UK of the musical form &quot;skiffle&quot; that had originated in the USA and had been popular in the US in the 1920s, '30s and '40s.  In addition to its popularity among British teenagers as music to listen to, it also spawned a craze of teenage boys starting their own groups to perform the music. One of the primary attractions was that it did not require great musical skills or expensive instruments to be played.&lt;ref name=&quot;BobTapes&quot;/&gt; Early British skiffle was played by [[Trad jazz|traditional jazz]] musicians.  The most successful British proponent of the genre in the 1950s was [[Lonnie Donegan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DoneganDies&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2400229.stm |title='Skiffle king' Donegan dies |publisher=BBC |date=4 November 2002 |accessdate=29 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quarrymen's initial repertoire included several songs that Donegan had recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp52&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p52&lt;/ref&gt;
When Lennon wanted to try making music himself, he and fellow Quarry Bank school friend Griffiths took guitar lessons in [[Hunt's Cross]], Liverpool, although Lennon gave up the lessons soon after, as they were based on theory and not actual playing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp48&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p48&lt;/ref&gt;

As Griffiths already knew how to play the banjo, Lennon's mother showed them how to tune the top four strings of their guitars to the same notes as a banjo, taught them the chords of [[Chord (music)|D, C, and D7]], and the [[Fats Domino]] song, &quot;[[Ain't That a Shame]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp48&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD&quot;&gt;”The Beatles Anthology” DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:14:29) Lennon talking about his mother teaching him &quot;Ain't That a Shame&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; They practiced at Lennon's aunt's house (called ''Mendips'') at [[251 Menlove Avenue]] where Lennon lived, or at Griffiths' house in Halewood Drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp49&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p49&lt;/ref&gt; They learned how to play &quot;[[Rock Island Line (song)|Rock Island Line]]&quot;, &quot;Jump Down Turn Around (Pick a Bale of Cotton)&quot;, &quot;[[Alabamy Bound]]&quot; and &quot;[[Cumberland Gap]]&quot;, and later learned how to play &quot;[[That's All Right]]&quot; and &quot;[[Mean Woman Blues]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD&quot;&gt;”The Beatles Anthology” DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:12:39) Harrison talking about Lonnie Donegan and the influence of “Rock Island Line”.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp49&quot;/&gt;

Lennon started his own skiffle band (very briefly called &quot;The Blackjacks&quot;) with Griffiths in the summer of 1956, and recruited Shotton, his best friend, even though Shotton could not play any instrument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp49&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:995j8qmtbtn4 AMG biography] Retrieved: 29 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PeteShottonQuarrymenpage&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/pete.html |title=Pete Shotton&amp;nbsp;– Washboard |publisher=Original Quarrymen |accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shotton elected to play the washboard, as it simply required percussive strumming and no lessons, so his mother supplied a washboard she found in the [[shed]], and two [[thimble]]s from her sewing box.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp50&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p50&lt;/ref&gt; A week later Shotton asked Bill Smith, another school friend, to play home-made [[Washtub_bass#Tea_Chest_Bass|&quot;tea-Chest&quot; bass]] and Griffiths invited another school friend Rod Davis (who had just purchased a banjo) to join the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp50&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DavisOriginalQuarrymen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/rod.html |title=Rod Davis (Banjo&amp;nbsp;– now Guitar) |publisher=Original Quarrymen |accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GriffithsOriginalQuarrymen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/eric.html |title=Eric Griffiths&amp;nbsp;— Guitar |publisher=Original Quarrymen |accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After a few days the Blackjacks name was abandoned.  Both Lennon and Shotton have been credited with coining the name Quarrymen after a line in their school's song: ''&quot;Quarrymen, old before our birth. Straining each muscle and sinew&quot;''. The choice of name was tongue-in-cheek as Lennon regarded the reference in the school song to &quot;straining each muscle and sinew&quot; as risible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp52&quot;/&gt; [http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/myth_8.html]

==The Quarrymen==
{{See|The Beatles' line-ups}}
[[Image:Glass washboard.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A 20th-century washboard, similar to the one played by Shotton]]
The group first rehearsed in Shotton's house on Vale Road, but because of the noise his mother told them to use the [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated]] [[Anderson shelter|air-raid shelter]] in the back garden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp51&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p51&lt;/ref&gt; Smith performed at only two shows and rarely turned up for rehearsals so Lennon decided that he should be replaced by his friend Len Garry. At the time of this decision, Smith happened to have possession of the group's tea-chest bass so, fearing an adverse reaction from Smith about his dismissal, Lennon and Shotton decided to break into Smith's parents' garage and they &quot;liberated&quot; their instrument.  Another Lennon friend, [[Ivan Vaughan]], occasionally played at rehearsals when Garry was not available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp53&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GarryOriginalQuarrymen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/len.html |title=Len Garry&amp;nbsp;— Tea-chest bass&amp;nbsp;— now guitar |publisher=Original Quarrymen |accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Hanton was an apprentice at Guy Rogers' [[upholstery]] company in [[Speke]], and travelled to work on the same bus as Griffiths used to get to school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scorpweb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.scorpweb.co.uk/html/quarrymen.html |title=John Lennon’s Original Quarrymen |publisher=Scorpweb |date=12 April 2008 |accessdate=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanton mentioned that he had a set of drums, but said that he was only an amateur.  Griffiths went to Hanton's house to watch him play.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuarrymenInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Thiessen |first=Dr. Bruce L. |url=http://www.tollbooth.org/2006/features/qmen.html |title=Before They Were The Beatles |publisher=The Phantom Tollbooth |accessdate=29 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths invited Hanton to join the Quarrymen, as having a drummer was a clear advantage for a group in Liverpool at the time, because they could then play rock 'n' roll songs as well as skiffle tunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp53&quot;/&gt;

Rehearsals were moved from the cold air-raid shelter to Hanton's or Griffiths' house—as Griffiths' father had died in WWII, and his mother worked all day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp54&quot;/&gt; The band also often visited Lennon's mother at 1 Blomfield Road, listening to her collection of rock 'n' roll records by Elvis, [[Shirley Goodman|Shirly and Lee]]'s &quot;[[Let the Good Times Roll (Shirley and Lee song)|Let the Good Times Roll]]&quot;, and [[Gene Vincent]]'s &quot;[[Be-Bop-A-Lula]]&quot; which they added to their repertoire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp55&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p55&lt;/ref&gt; Another school friend, &lt;!-- IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!!!!!    Nigel Walley's name is mis-spelled in multiple Beatles' books.  As per Walley himself on the official Quarrymen website - his name is spelled with no &quot;H&quot;.  It is WALLEY   --&gt; [[Nigel Walley]], occasionally lent a hand playing tea-chest bass, but he lost his instrument when he left it at a bus stop, so he decided to become their manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCQuarrymenQA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/content/articles/2007/10/02/northwest_quarrymen_qa_s12_3_feature.shtml |title=The Quarrymen Q &amp; A |publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not secure the group many paid engagements, he sent flyers to local theatres and ballrooms, and put up posters designed by Lennon: &quot;Country-and-western, rock n' roll, skiffle band&amp;nbsp;— The Quarrymen&amp;nbsp;— Open for Engagements&amp;nbsp;— Please Call Nigel Walley, Tel.Gateacre 1715&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp54&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p54&lt;/ref&gt;
Walley did manage to secure two [[intermission]] concerts at the Gaumont cinema (near [[Penny Lane]]) on Saturday afternoons, and the Quarrymen performed at parties and skiffle contests in the Liverpool area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp56&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HantonOriginalQuarrymen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/colin.html |title=Colin Hanton&amp;nbsp;— Drummer |publisher=Original Quarrymen |accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian impresario [[Carroll Levis]] organised a skiffle contest, at which he instructed all eight acts to play for just three minutes each. The Quarrymen played &quot;[[Worried Man Blues]]&quot;, and were loudly applauded, but a group from Wales called the Sunnyside Skiffle Group &quot;jumped all over the stage&quot; and outshone the static Quarrymen, and were asked by Levis to fill in the last few minutes of the contest with a second song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp57&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p57&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon argued heatedly with Levis backstage, saying the Sunnyside Skiffle Group had brought a bus full of supporters with them, and were given &quot;the upper hand&quot; advantage by Levis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp57&quot;/&gt; After the competition, Levis used a [[clap-o-meter]] (a machine to measure the decibels of the audience's reaction to the groups) as they were asked to walk back out onto the stage. The Quarrymen and the Sunnyside skiffle Group both tied by reaching ninety on the meter, but after a second test, the Quarrymen lost by a small margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp58&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p58&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Item-ps-250-(plectrum-special)-1458 lg.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Lennon's mother, Griffiths and Davis all played the banjo, and Lennon first learned banjo chords on his guitar]]
Whilst playing golf with Dr. Joseph Sytner, Walley—who had left school at 15 to become an apprentice golf professional at the Lee Park Golf Club—asked Dr. Sytner if his son, Alan, could book the Quarrymen at [[The Cavern]], in [[Mathew Street]], which was one of three jazz clubs he managed. Sytner suggested that the band should play at the golf club first, so as to assess their talent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp59&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p59&lt;/ref&gt; The band set up in the downstairs lounge of the golf club, and were surprised when nearly one hundred people filed in to listen. Just before the performance, the [[Zipper|zip]] on Davis' jeans broke, and he had to cover his crotch with his banjo.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuarrymenInterview&quot;/&gt; The performance was a success, a hat was later passed and almost £15 was collected, which was much more than any other groups were paid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp60&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p60&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Sytner phoned Walley a week later and offered the group an interlude spot playing skiffle between the performances of two jazz bands at the Cavern.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp61&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p61&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Cavern performance, the Quarrymen played (gratis) for St. Peter's Youth Club, in St. Barnabas Church hall, and were the main act at a Quarry Bank school dance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp61&quot;/&gt; During this time Lennon heard [[Little Richard]] singing &quot;[[Long Tall Sally]]&quot; for the first time at classmate Michael Hill's house near Penny Lane, and thought Richard a better singer than Elvis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp62&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p62&lt;/ref&gt;  The group learned how to play numerous Elvis songs such as, &quot;[[Don't Be Cruel]], &quot;[[All Shook Up]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Heartbreak Hotel]]&quot;, as well as songs by [[Eddie Cochran]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp63&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p63&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Cavern Club performance, the group argued amongst themselves about the set list, as rock 'n' roll songs were definitely not allowed at the club, but skiffle was tolerated as it was considered to be an off-shoot of jazz. After beginning with a skiffle song, Lennon called for the others to start playing &quot;[[Don't Be Cruel]]&quot;. Davis warned Lennon that the audience would &quot;eat you alive&quot;, but Lennon ignored this and started playing the song himself, forcing the others to join in. Halfway through, Sytner pushed his way through the audience and handed Lennon a note which read, &quot;Cut out the bloody rock 'n' roll&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp65&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p65&lt;/ref&gt;

After playing at an outdoor birthday party at Hanton's aunt's house, Shotton decided to leave the band, saying &quot;I hate this, John--it's not for me&quot;. Lennon promptly picked up the washboard and smashed it over Shotton's head, leaving only the wooden frame hanging on Shotton's shoulders, and then said, &quot;Well, that solves ''that'' then, doesn't it?&quot; At Lennon's pleading, Shotton agreed to play a few more engagements (with his repaired washboard) before finally leaving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp66&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p66&lt;/ref&gt; On Saturday 22 June 1957, the Quarrymen played a major performance;— two sets on a stationary [[flatbed truck]] at an outdoor party in Rosebery Street, Liverpool, to celebrate the 750th anniversary of the granting of Liverpool’s charter by [[John of England|King John]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReflectionsInterviewWithBaird&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lennon.net/reflections/julia_baird.shtml |title=An Interview With Julia Baird |publisher=Liverpool Lennons |accessdate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeatlesTimeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://home.att.net/~chuckayoub/1957_1960_years.htm |title=The Beatles Timeline 1957 - 1960 |publisher=The BeatlesTimeline |accessdate=29 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday 6 July 1957, the Quarrymen played at St. Peter's Church ''Rose Queen'' garden fête in [[Woolton]]. They first played on the back of a moving flatbed lorry, in a procession of [[Float (parade)|floats]] that carried the Rose Queen and retiring Rose Queen, [[Morris dancers]], [[Boy Scout]]s, [[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownies]], [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting|Girl Guides]] and [[Cub Scouts|Cubs]], led by the Band of the Cheshire Yeomanry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milesp25&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p25&lt;/ref&gt; At 4:15 they played onstage in a field behind the church, before a display by the City of Liverpool Police Dogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilesPage26&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp93-94&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) pp93-94&lt;/ref&gt; They were playing &quot;[[Come Go with Me]]&quot; when Paul McCartney arrived, and in the Scout hut after the set, Ivan Vaughan introduced McCartney to Lennon, who chatted for a few minutes before the band set up in the church hall for their performance at that evening's &quot;Grand Dance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD&quot;&gt;”The Beatles Anthology” DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:21:56) Lennon talking about meeting McCartney.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage95&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p95&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney demonstrated how he tuned his guitar then sang Eddie Cochran's &quot;[[Twenty Flight Rock]]&quot; and Gene Vincent's &quot;[[Be-Bop-A-Lula]]&quot;, and a medley of Little Richard songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilesPage26&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage96&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p96&lt;/ref&gt;

As they were walking home after the evening performance, Lennon and Shotton discussed the afternoon encounter with McCartney, and Lennon said that perhaps they should invite McCartney to join the band. Two weeks later Shotton encountered McCartney cycling through Woolton, and conveyed Lennon's casual invitation for him to join the Quarrymen, and Vaughan also invited McCartney to join.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilesPage26&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p26&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney said he would join after [[West Lancashire Scout County (The Scout Association)|Scout camp]] in [[Hathersage]], and a holiday with his family at [[Butlins]] holiday camp in [[Filey]], Yorkshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milesp29&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p.29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage99&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p99&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, Davis went on holiday to [[Annecy]], France, and when he returned he discovered that McCartney had joined the group.  With McCartney joining, rock 'n' roll songs were replacing much of the skiffle material in the group's repertoire.  Davis felt that the banjo was ill-suited to the group's new direction and he withdrew from the group without rancour.   In 1960, while studying at Cambridge University, Davis recorded the song &quot;Running Shoes&quot; with the Trad Grads, for [[Decca Records]] (Decca, 45-F 11403) which he later mentioned to an envious Lennon.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage99&quot;/&gt;

When McCartney returned from holiday he began rehearsing with the Quarrymen, playing songs such as, &quot;[[Bye Bye Love]]&quot; (The Everly Brothers) and &quot;[[All Shook Up]]&quot;, that Lennon and the group had been trying to learn, without success.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage102&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p102&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney made his debut with the band on Friday, 18 October 1957 at a [[Association of Conservative Clubs|Conservative Club]] social held at the New Clubmoor Hall in the [[Norris Green]] section of Liverpool.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage108&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MilesPage29&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p29&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon and McCartney wore cream-coloured sports jackets, which were paid for by the whole group—Walley collected half a crown per week from each member until they were paid for—and the others wore white shirts with [[tassels]] and black [[bootlace tie]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage108&quot;/&gt; To the irritation of the other group members, McCartney endlessly practiced the lead guitar intro to &quot;[[Raunchy (song)|Raunchy]]&quot; (by saxophonist Bill Justis) and a solo from &quot;Guitar Boogie Shuffle&quot;, for days before the engagement, but on the night (after being specially introduced by Lennon as a new member of the group) he missed his cue on &quot;Raunchy&quot;, played all the wrong notes, and stepped back in embarrassment between Hanton and Garry. Everyone expected Lennon to say something sarcastic, but the sight of the always over-confident McCartney looking so crestfallen made Lennon laugh out loud so much that he &quot;almost pissed himself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage109&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p109&lt;/ref&gt; On Thursday, 7 November, Charlie McBain booked the Quarrymen to appear at the Wilson Hall [[Garston, Merseyside]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray O'Brien (2001) ''There are Places I'll Remember: Volume 1''&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Harrison===
The Quarrymen played the New Clubmoor Hall on 10 January 1958 and at the Cavern on 24 January. McCartney's school friend, Harrison (from a year below at the Liverpool Institute, which they both attended) first saw the group perform on 6 February at Wilson Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot; SpitzPage125&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p125&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison then auditioned for the Quarrymen in [[Rory Storm]]'s ''Morgue Skiffle Club'', playing &quot;Guitar Boogie Shuffle&quot; (by [[Bert Weedon]]) in March 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp126&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BillHarryPage2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/rorystorm-hurricanes2.shtml |title=While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Tragic Story of Rory Storm &amp; the Hurricanes (page 2) |publisher=[[Bill Harry]]|accessdate=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon thought Harrison (at 14) was too young to join the band, so McCartney engineered another meeting on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played &quot;Raunchy&quot; for Lennon.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilesPage47&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; SpitzPage127&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p127&lt;/ref&gt; After McCartney's constant advocacy Lennon allowed the recently turned fifteen-year-old Harrison to join the Quarrymen as [[lead guitarist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD&quot;&gt;”The Beatles Anthology” DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:21:56) McCartney talking about Harrison being in the band.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MilesPage47&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; SpitzPage126-127&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) pp126–127&lt;/ref&gt; The group then rehearsed at McCartney's house, but Griffiths was not told. When he coincidentally telephoned the McCartney house, Lennon, Harrison and McCartney sat in the back room, forcing Hanton to explain the situation. Griffiths left the Quarrymen soon after.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage128&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p128&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, Garry contracted [[Tuberculous meningitis|tubercular meningitis]], and spent seven months in [[Fazakerley]] hospital, and never played with the group again.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage128&quot;/&gt; During 1958, McCartney played his first self-composed song, &quot;I've Lost My Little Girl&quot;, to Lennon, who was shocked and impressed, according to Shotton's account.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage130&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p130&lt;/ref&gt; The Quarrymen learned many of [[The Everly Brothers]] songs, such as, &quot;[[Cathy's Clown]], &quot;[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wake Up Little Susie]]&quot;, and even [[B-sides]] of the records, which helped to refine Lennon and McCartney's own harmony singing.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage131&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p131&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths joined the [[Merchant Marine]] after leaving the group—visiting ports in South America and Canada—and upon his return to Liverpool he would either sell or swap records by Buddy Holly or [[Chuck Berry]] with Lennon or McCartney.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage131-132&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) pp131-132&lt;/ref&gt; According to McCartney it was Holly who inspired Lennon and himself to write more songs, as Holly wrote his own instead of relying on a team of songwriters.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD&quot;&gt;”The Beatles Anthology” DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:09:49) McCartney talking about Buddy Holly and writing of songs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage132&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p132&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the songs Lennon and McCartney wrote at that time were later recorded: &quot;[[One After 909]]&quot; (by the Beatles themselves and included on the ''[[Let It Be]]'' album) and &quot;[[Like Dreamers Do]]&quot;, which was a hit for [[The Applejacks (UK band)|The Applejacks]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpitzPage133&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p133&lt;/ref&gt;  Lennon's first self-composed song &quot;[[Hello Little Girl]]&quot; was also written in this period.   John Duff Lowe (a schoolmate of McCartney's) played piano with the group occasionally in the summer of 1958, on the occasions when a piano was available at a venue.&lt;ref name=&quot;DuffLoweOriginalQuarrymen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.originalquarrymen.co.uk/html/duff1.html |title=John Duff Lowe joins theQuarrymen&amp;nbsp;— again! |publisher=Original Quarrymen |accessdate=30 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
[[Image:Percy Phillips record.jpg|right|200px|thumb|&quot;In Spite of All the Danger&quot;, the only copy of the shellac acetate containing the only two songs professionally recorded by The Quarrymen]]
Percy Phillips' operated a studio called [[Phillips' Sound Recording Services]] at 38 Kensington, Liverpool, between the kitchen and a front room that served as an electrical goods shop .&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp141&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p141&lt;/ref&gt; Actors from the Liverpool Playhouse often stayed in the room above the studio, and were asked by Phillips to record monologues and poems. Phillips had just turned 60-years-old when Harrison heard about the studio from Storm's guitarist, Johnny Byrne, who had recorded a version of &quot;[[Butterfly (1957 song)|Butterfly]]&quot; there on 22 June 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp141&quot;/&gt;

The Quarrymen booked the studio, but when Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Hanton and Lowe arrived they were surprised to see how small and technically basic it was, with one solitary microphone in the centre of the room.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp142&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p142&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 [[shillings]] and 6 pence, but Phillips then asked for an extra surcharge to cover the cost of transferring the tape recording to disc. As this was too expensive, Phillips said that for a cut-rate price they would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp142&quot;/&gt;

The group had decided to record &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; as one of their two songs, but had not decided on the song for the other side of the disc. After recording &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot; (Lennon suggested that Hanton put a scarf over the snare drum to lower the volume) Phillips wanted them to immediately record the next song. They asked for some time to rehearse, but Phillips refused, saying, &quot;For seventeen and six [[Shilling|17]]/[[Sixpence (British coin)|6d]] you're not here all day&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp143&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p143&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney suggested &quot;In Spite of All the Danger&quot; (a very early composition by McCartney with some assistance from Harrison) even though Lowe and Hanton had never heard it before.&lt;ref name=&quot;HantonOriginalQuarrymen&quot;/&gt; Lowe and Hanton busked through the song, and Phillips then handed the group a fragile [[78rpm]] record, which was passed around the band for one week each, or lent out to friends. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp143&quot;/&gt;

==The Quarrymen to The Beatles==
{{Main|The Beatles}}
Lennon's mother, Julia, was killed in a road accident on 15 July 1958, and Lennon lost interest in the group for months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milesp50&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p50&lt;/ref&gt; Lowe gave up guesting with the group on piano as he lived too far away from where they rehearsed, and having to travel by bus meant he could only rehearse at weekends.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuarrymenInterview&quot;/&gt; The group continued to play, such as at the wedding reception of Harrison's brother, Harry, in Speke, on 20 December 1958, and at Art School dances every other Friday, where they were billed as &quot;The College Band&quot; (although the first two performances were without Hanton).&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp149-150&quot;/&gt;

After two further performances (on 1 January, at a Speke Bus Depot social club party at Wilson Hall organised by Harrison’s father, and on 24 January, at a party at Woolton Village Club) they played at the Pavilion Theatre in Lodge Lane, where the management was looking for a regular group to play 30-minute sets between the bingo sessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp149-150&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) pp149-150&lt;/ref&gt;  The first set at the Pavilion Theatre went well, but in the interval Lennon, McCartney and Hanton drank beer supplied by the management, and then moved onto &quot;[[Black Velvet (beer cocktail)|Poor Man's Black Velvets]]&quot;: a mix of two half-pints of [[Guinness]] and [[cider]] together. As Lennon, McCartney and Hanton were obviously drunk the second set was a shambles, and on the bus ride home a drunken McCartney fiercely criticised Hanton for not being good enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp150&quot;/&gt; Shotton (who had been at the theatre to watch) stepped between them to stop Hanton physically attacking McCartney, and helped Hanton off the bus with his drums. Hanton was never contacted again; only hearing something on TV three years later, when they were called The Beatles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp150&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:McCartney and Lennon at The Casbah Club.jpg|thumb|left|200px| McCartney and Lennon playing on the opening night of the Casbah Coffee Club]]
Lennon and McCartney continued to write songs together, but as no engagements were forthcoming, Harrison asked to join Storm's Tornados, but Storm's mother refused, saying Harrison was far too young. Harrison then joined the Les Stewart Quartet with Les Stewart, guitarist Ken Brown, and Geoff Skinner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp152&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p152&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mona Best]] opened [[The Casbah Coffee Club]] on 29 August 1959, and Brown arranged for the quartet to be its resident band. When Brown missed rehearsals to help decorate the Casbah, Stewart refused to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp161&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p161&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and Harrison recruited Lennon and McCartney at short notice to help them fill the residency, and they reactivated the Quarrymen name for the occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp161&quot;/&gt; They played a series of seven Saturday night engagements in the Casbah for 15 shillings each per night, starting on 29 August to October 1959, featuring Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Brown as the &quot;honorary Quarryman&quot;.  They performed without a drummer, and with only one [[microphone]] connected to the club's small [[Public address|PA]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milesp51&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CasbahPhotos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Hughs |url=http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1950s/59.08.29%20casbah/59.08.29casbah.html |title=Casbah photos |publisher=The Source |accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe.&lt;ref name=&quot;CynthiaJohnp44&quot;&gt;Lennon (2006) ''John'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the first night, Mona gave the Quarrymen a residency, but as there was no amplification, Lennon persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before the Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his 40-watt [[amplifier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp162-163&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) pp162-163&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October, there was an argument between the band and Best over the group's fee for performing in the Casbah that night. Brown had showed up at the house, but was too ill to perform, so Best told him to rest upstairs in the Best's living room. She later insisted that Brown deserved to be paid for showing up, but, led by McCartney, the rest of the group insisted on being paid his share of the group's fee. After an argument the Quarrymen walked out of the Casbah and ended their residency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp164&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p164; ''The Times'' obituary of Ken Brown, 27 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:EmpireTheatre.JPG|250px|right|thumb|The Liverpool Empire Theatre, where Johnny and the Moondogs auditioned: Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison]]
As the first prize was a TV appearance on Carrol Levis' ''Discoveries'' TV show, the group entered the ''Star Search'' competition as Johnny and the Moondogs, with only Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milesp51&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p51&lt;/ref&gt; The first heat was held at the [[Liverpool Empire Theatre]] on 18 October 1959, and after they passed the audition they were asked to play at the Manchester Hippodrome for the local finals, on Sunday 15 November 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp170&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p170&lt;/ref&gt; This date has been disputed as being Monday 24 November 1958, as UK theatres were closed on Sundays in those days.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoondogsHippodrome&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rickresource.com/stt-research/jandmoondogs.html |title=Johhny and the Moondogs |last=Fletcher |first=Tim |work=RickResource.com |date=6 April 2002 |accessdate=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ray Ennis of the Swinging Bluegenes (later called [[The Swinging Blue Jeans]]) the registration process in Manchester took all day, as there was a queue of musicians carrying amplifiers and instruments that stretched all the way around the building. Lennon (without a guitar), McCartney, and Harrison played Buddy Holly's &quot;Think It Over&quot;, but the last train or bus left for Liverpool at 9:47, and at 9:20 there were still 12 acts to perform. As the trio only had [[£]]1 between them, it was impossible to stay any longer. As they were leaving, Lennon saw a cutaway electric guitar by the stage door, picked it up and walked off with it, later saying that the trip &quot;wasn't a total loss.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD&quot;&gt;”The Beatles Anthology” DVD (2003) (Episode 1 - 0:27:11) McCartney talking about Lennon stealing a guitar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp170-171&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) pp170-171&lt;/ref&gt;

During the school holidays of 1960, Lennon and McCartney performed together twice as the Nerk Twins, after hitchhiking to the Fox and Hounds pub in [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], which was managed by Mike Robbins and his wife Elizabeth (McCartney's cousin). Robbins had previously been in a group called the Jones Boys, and told stories to Lennon and McCartney about show business.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milesp51&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p51&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon and McCartney worked in the bar for the whole week for £5 each, performing on Saturday 23 April 1960, and again on Sunday, before returning to Liverpool.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milesp52&quot;&gt;Miles (1997) p52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stuart Sutcliffe===
Lennon, along with fellow art students [[Bill Harry]], [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] and Rod Murray, saw the poet [[Royston Ellis]] at Liverpool University, and later met in a Liverpool pub, [[Ye Cracke]]. Being disappointed with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled quartet of friends the Dissenters, and make Liverpool famous: Lennon with his music, Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings and Harry with his writing,&lt;ref name=&quot;TheDissenters&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/about/founders-story.shtml |title=Bill &amp; Virginia Harry |publisher=Triumpg pc |accessdate=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after talking to Sutcliffe one night at the Casbah Coffee Club, Lennon and McCartney persuaded Sutcliffe to buy a [[Höfner]] 500/5 bass—known in Europe as a ''President'' bass—with the money he had won in the John Moore art exhibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD&quot;&gt;”The Beatles Anthology” DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:28:02) Harrison and McCartney talking about Sutcliffe’s first bass guitar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockmine.com/Stu2.html Sutcliffe's President Bass] rockmine.com&amp;nbsp;— Retrieved: 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/sutcliffe/cheque.asp Sutcliffe's cheque book -] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk&amp;nbsp;— Retrieved: 13 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1960, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison were joined by Sutcliffe, who according to some sources suggested changing their name to the Beatals/Beetles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp175&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SutcliffeBeatals&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=83842 |title=The Beatles story, Liverpool: The Quarrymen and Skiffle&amp;nbsp;— the United Kingdom Years |publisher=PR News wire Europe Limited |accessdate=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the group always had to rely on the [[Public address|P.A. system]] in the places they played, they realised they had to buy their own. Harry often heard Lennon, McCartney and Harrison rehearsing or playing in the Art College canteen in the basement,&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp138&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p138&lt;/ref&gt; but after Sutcliffe joined the Quarrymen, Harry complained that Sutcliffe should be concentrating on art and not music, as he thought he was a competent, but not brilliant bassist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp173-174&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) pp173-174&lt;/ref&gt;

As Harry and Sutcliffe were members of the Liverpool College of Art's Student Union committee, they put forward the idea that the college should buy its own P.A. system for college dances, which the Quarrymen often played at, although the equipment would later be appropriated by the group, and taken to Hamburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp176&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p176&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 7 March 1962, the Student’s Union sent Pete Mackey to ask Lennon to return the equipment, or pay for it, but Lennon told him it had been sold in Hamburg.&lt;ref name=&quot;IssueNo23&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.merseybeat.co.uk/articles-details.php?cat=Bill+Harry's+Mersey+Beat&amp;id=546 |title=Issue No.23 Mersey Beat Reveals The Beatles Are To Record! |publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles' manager, [[Brian Epstein]], contacted Fred O’ Brien from the Student’s Union and offered him the chance of a Liverpool Art College dance concert (featuring The Beatles for the minimal sum of £5 as recompense) but was turned down.&lt;ref name=&quot;InterviewwithMerseyBeatfounderBillHarry&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://liverpooldays.com/photo/thumbnails.php?album=32 |title=An Interview with Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry |publisher=Liverpool Days |accessdate=13 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sutcliffe was turned down when he returned from Hamburg to request he study for the ATD (Art Teachers Diploma) course at the college).&lt;ref name=&quot;IssueNo23&quot;/&gt;

Brian Cass, of Cass and the Casanovas, heard the group rehearsing one night in the [[Jacaranda]] club (managed by [[Allan Williams]]) and promised Lennon that if they changed their name to Long John and the Silver Beetles (after Buddy Holly and [[The Crickets]]) he would help them find a drummer. Lennon did not like the name, as he thought it made him sound like the fictional pirate [[Long John Silver]], but agreed to change the name to the Silver Beetles. In May 1960, they played a tour of Scotland under that name with Liverpool singer [[Larry Parnes|Johnny Gentle]]. They finally changed the name of the group to The Beatles for their performances in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CynthiaLennonJohnPage67&quot;&gt;Lennon (2006) p67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman (1984) p212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp180&quot;&gt;Spitz (2005) p180&lt;/ref&gt;

==1997 Reunion and beyond==
The surviving members of the original line-up of the Quarrymen reunited in 1997 for the 40th anniversary of their performance at the 1957 Woolton village fete - which was the occasion of the first meeting of Lennon and McCartney.  All five surviving original members [[Pete Shotton]], [[Rod Davis]], [[Len Garry]], [[Eric Griffiths]] and [[Colin Hanton]]. performed. Following this, the group continued to perform - undertaking tours of the UK, USA, Germany, Japan, Russia and other countries.  The group's repertoire focuses on the skiffle and early rock 'n' roll they played in their original incarnation with the added [[roots rock]] historical perspective of illustrating how American roots music inspired the nascent Beatles.

In 2000, producer and Beatles' historian [[Martin Lewis]] produced the group performing the Del-Vikings song ''[[Come Go with Me]]'' (the first song McCartney recalled hearing Lennon sing on the first day they met) - for use on the soundtrack of the [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] film ''[[Two of Us (TV film)|Two Of Us]]'' - a film about the last day that Lennon and McCartney saw each other - in April 1976.     

Eric Griffiths died in 2005, and Pete Shotton retired, owing to ill-health. As of 2010, the surviving three founder-members continue to perform around the world.  They are occasionally augmented by honorary member [[John Lowe (musician)|John Duff Lowe]] who played piano with the group briefly in the summer of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Guilford''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] in [[Chenango County, New York|Chenango County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The town is on the east border of the county. The population was 3,046 at the 2000 census.{{GR|2}} 

== History ==
The land was purchased from the [[Oneida tribe]] in 1785. 
The town was first settled around 1787.  One of the first settlements were in what is now known as East Guilford, by the Mercereau brothers(who were actually Revolutionary War spies fo George Washington).  They built a mill on Guilford Creek in Indian Orchard Falls, along the Catskill Turnpike.   

Guilford was formed from the town of [[Oxford, New York|Oxford]] in 1813 as &quot;Eastern.&quot; The name became &quot;Guilford&quot; in 1817. The town was called by an older name, &quot;Fayette,&quot; for the early part of its history during the time it was in [[Tioga County, New York|Tioga County]].

One of the most beautiful spots in Guilford is Guilford Lake, which was at one time called Guilford Pond.  There was actually a tornado that hit in Guilford around Guilford Lake at the turn of the century, that knocked down tons of tree limbs and trees.  

However, Guilford is especially known for The Angels Inn, otherwise known as The Pillars.  Unfortunately, this building in in desperate need of some tender love and care currently, however it is one of the most beautiful buildings in the area.  It used to have a carved wooden angel that hung above the door, but in the 50's it was sold for lots of money.  However, Guilford currently has a replica of the angel on display for those who want to see it.

During the cold war, Ellenburg was home to two of the 12 [[Atlas missile|Atlas]][[ICBM]] silos under the 556th Strategic Missile Squadron based out of the [[Plattsburgh AFB|Plattsburgh Air Force Base]]. These silos were operational from 1962-1965.

In late 2004, a [[wind farm]] was proposed by [http://www.noblepower.com/index.html Noble Environmental Power] for the northern part of the town. Construction was expected to be completed by early 2007 however due to delays and is now expected to only begin by summer of 2007. Noble has also proposed wind farms in the neighboring towns of [[Altona (town), New York|Altona]] and [[Chateaugay (town), New York|Chateaugay]]. Construction of the wind farms have caused some controversy within the towns as many residents feel it may subtract from the natural beauty of the area. The wind farm is expected to include 53 windmills and produce a total output of 1.21 gigawatts.

'''Rouses Point''' is a [[village]] in [[Clinton County, New York|Clinton County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,277 at the 2000 census. The village is named after Jacques Rouse, an early settler. 

The '''Village of Rouses Point''' is in northeast part of the [[Champlain (town), New York|Town of Champlain]] and is north of [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]]. It is less than 1 mile south of the [[Canada–United States border]].

== History ==
Rouses Point was first settled around 1783 by [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Nova Scotia]]n refugees who were granted tracts of land in reward for their services during the [[American Revolution]].  [[Steamboat]]s were a booming business on this part of the lake; the second commercial steamboat in the world was launched on [[Lake Champlain]] with Rouses Point as its first port-of-call.  Steamboat traffic continued on the lake for the next 100 years, until displaced by the [[railroad]].

Edward Thurber built the first frame house in 1818.  Legend has it that President [[James Monroe]] stayed there.  By 1860, Rouses Point had a variety of shops and tradespeople such as loggers, bakers, tailors, carpenters, blacksmiths, prostitutes, and hatters.  Its location on the Canadian border made it an important stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], through which many African-Americans escaped to freedom.

Rouses Point became an incorporated village in 1877, and grew quickly to a population of over 2,000 by 1892.  The [[Delaware and Hudson Railroad]] opened a station, connecting the village to [[New York City]] and [[Montreal]]. 

During [[Prohibition]] (1923–33), the village's proximity to the Canadian border made it popular with those who wanted to smuggle illegal alcohol across the border.  [[Rum-running]] became common, and three [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]], one called &quot;The Bucket of Blood&quot; operated nightly.  Organized crime visited the area, bringing with it the usual vices.

During [[World War II]], the community was the scene of substantial shipments of war materials to points north by water and rail.  

Today, the lake at Rouses Point has three marinas filled with pleasure craft.  [[Wyeth]], a pharmaceutical company, formerly employed over 1,000 people.

== History ==
Originally part of the Land Grant to the Livingston family, this area on the Roeliff-Jansen Kill was originally called &quot;Livingston Forge&quot; after the iron foundry on the river.  Throughout the eighteenth century. the Livingston forge created metal products for the community, and the town was sometimes known as &quot;Scotchtown&quot; due to the immigrants of Scottish ancestry to flocked there.  As the Revolution drew near, the factory produced shot, cannonballs, and perhaps most importantly, the chain which stretched across the Hudson River at West Point.  

After the Revolution, the town was established from part of the [[Livingston, New York|Town of Livingston]] in 1803, but was then called the &quot;Town of Gallatin.&quot;  In 1814, the name was changed to &quot;Ancram,&quot; after the town in Scotland where the Livingstons had their origins.

'''Austerlitz''' is a [[town]] in [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].  The population was 1,453 at the 2000 census.  The town was named after the [[Battle of Austerlitz]].

The '''Town of Austerlitz''' is in the east part of Columbia County.

== History ==
Ellis, Capt. Franklin, &quot;History of Columbia County, New York&quot;, (1878), page 381

The town was organized from parts of the towns of Hillsdale, Chatham, and Canaan, March 28, 1878(sic 1818).  A little more than one-fifteenth of the present town was taken from Chatham, a little over one-eighth from Canaan, and a little less than five-sixths from Hillsdale.  From the fact that among the first settlers there were no less than twelve families of Spencers, the north part of Hillsdale and been known from the first as &quot;Spencer's-town.&quot;  This name finally attached itself simply to the village, and when the division of the town was being talked up it was proposed to call the new town &quot;New Ulm.&quot;  When the bill erecting it passed the Legislature, however, Martin Van Buren, then a State Senator, and who, being an ardent admirer of the great Napoleon, was somewhat incensed at one of his political opponents (Elisha Williams, if we mistake not), who had succeeded in having a town in Seneca county christened &quot;Waterloo,&quot; leaped to his feet and moved to amend by calling the new town &quot;Austerlitz.&quot;  Having carried his point, he retired to his seat, saying &quot;There's an Austerlitz for your Waterloo.&quot; 
=== Past residents of note ===
[[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], poet, lived at [[Steepletop]], a more than {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} property that had previously been a farm.

'''Clermont''' is a [[town]] in [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], [[New York]], [[United States]].  The population was 1,726 at the 2000 census. The name of the town is French for &quot;Clear Mountain,&quot; referring to the mountain views in the town.

The '''Town of Clermont''' is in the southwest part of the county, south of the [[Hudson, New York|City of Hudson]].

==History==

&quot;Clermont&quot; was originally one of the oldest of the great estates of the mid-Hudson valley.

The [[Clermont Manor]] was established in 1728, in what is now the Town of Clermont. The manor was originally part of the 160,000 acre (650&amp;nbsp;km²) [[Livingston Manor]]; Clermont was a 13,000 acre (53&amp;nbsp;km²) section in the southwest corner that was bequeathed to [[Robert Livingston (1688-1775)|Robert Livingston]], a younger son.  His descendants would come to own more than 500,000 acres (2,000&amp;nbsp;km²) in the [[Catskill Mountains]] and more than 100,000 acres (400&amp;nbsp;km²) in [[Dutchess County]].

Clermont marked the northernmost penetration by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops up the [[Hudson River]] during the [[American Revolution]]; Livingston’s home was burned because of his prominent role in the Revolution.  It was rebuilt between 1779 and 1782. The house is now a 500 acre (2&amp;nbsp;km²) historic [[New York State Historic Site]] and a [[United States National Historic Landmark]].

In 1788, Clermont Manor was organized as the Town of Clermont.

Clermont was the port of registry of [[Robert Fulton]]'s first steamboat, co-owned by Livingston, which was called the &quot;North River&quot;.  Today it is known as the &quot;Clermont.&quot;  The ruins of its dock can still be found at the historic site.

The estate, and later the town, was home to seven generations of the [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Livingston]] family until 1962.

'''Copake''' is a [[town]] in [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], [[United States]]. [[New York]], [[United States]].  The population was 3,278 at the 2000 census.  The town derives its name from a lake, which was known to the natives as &quot;Snake Pond.&quot;    The town borders [[Taconic State Park]].

The '''Town of Copake''' is on the eastern border of the county.

==History==
Copake is part of the 1686 Taconic Grant to Robert Livingston for about 400 acres of good land and 2,200 acres of woodland. After it was purchased from the Indians it turned out to be 160,000 acre and he established the English style Livingston Manor.  The Manor extended well into what is now Massachuetts. The first lease given by Livingston in Copake was for about 85 acres in 1687 to Matthews Abraham Van Deusen.  Because New England claimed ownership west to the Hudson River a border dispute broke out.  The Boston Bay Colony laid out three townships west of the Taconic Mountains in 1755.  Most of the present Town of Copake was in one of the townships. New settlers were given 100 acres free and some of Livingston’s tenants refused to pay rent. The border was settled in 1757 by the Lords Commissioners of Trade in London.  Farmers west of the border continued to protest, however.  In 1844 a rally organized by the Taconic Mutual Association took place in the center of the hamlet. After the rally the arrest of several of the leaders sparked wider protests. Eventually the Anti-Rent Party was formed in New York State and New York instituted land reform. The Anti-Rent Party called for a Homestead Act to develop the western land.  It became part of the Republican Party and was important in the election of Lincoln in 1860.
The Township of Copake was formed in 1824 by splitting it from the Town of Granger that was renamed Taghkanic.  A former early industry was [[iron]] mining and smelting. Adjacent to the village of Copake Falls in [[Taconic State Park]] is the &quot;Ore Pit&quot;, a former iron mine, now a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} deep swimming pond.

'''Cortland''' is a [[city]] in [[Cortland County, New York]], [[United States|USA]]. As of the 2000 census, the city had a population of 18,740. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]]{{GR|6}}.

The City of Cortland, near the west border of the county, is surrounded by the [[Cortlandville, New York|Town of Cortlandville]].

== History ==
The city is within the former [[Central New York Military Tract]]. The city is named after [[Pierre Van Cortlandt]] the first Lieutenant Governor of the State of New York.

Cortland, settled in 1791, was made a village in 1853 (rechartered in 1864), and was [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] as a city in 1900 as the 41st city in the State of [[New York]]. When the county was formed in 1808, Cortland vied with other villages and won the status of becoming the county seat. The City of Cortland is the [[county seat]] of Cortland County. Known as the &quot;Crown City&quot; because of its location on a [[plain]] formed by the convergence of seven valleys, Cortland is situated about 1,130 feet (344 m) above sea level, making it the uppermost city to crown the state.
Forty stars, representing the 40 cities incorporated before Cortland, circle the State of New York and Crown on the Official [[City Seal]]. The seven points of the Crown create seven valleys depicting Cortland's seven surrounding valleys. The 41st star in the center of the Crown illustrates Cortland as the closest incorporated City to the geographic center of New York.

The leading industry in Cortland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was the Wickwire Brothers wire drawing mill, noted for its production of wire hardware cloth for use as window screens.  The extent of their wealth is commemorated in a pair of magnificent mansions, the Victorian gothic home of Chester Wickwire is now the &quot;1890 House Museum and Center for the Victorian Arts&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1890house.org/ The 1890 House Museum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while the 1912 home of Charles Wickwire is now called the SUNY Cortland Alumni House and is owned and operated by the SUNY Cortland Alumni Association. It is open to the public as well as being used by the Alumni Association to host College related events and house visiting dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cortland.edu/alumnihouse/ SUNY(State University of New York) Cortland Alumni House&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Cortland was also home to a pioneering [[truck]] maker, [[Brockway Motor Company|Brockway]]. Begun in 1875 as Brockway Carriage Works, it was taken over by [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] in 1956, and survived until 1977. The city continues to host an annual show of Brockway trucks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brockwaytrucks.org/ Brockway Truck Preservation Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cortland also boasts a classic [[Octagon house]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.octagon.bobanna.com/ Octagon House Inventory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 Cortland became the home of the Cortland Normal School, now the [[State University of New York at Cortland]].

'''McGraw''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] in [[Cortland County, New York|Cortland County]], [[New York]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,000 at the 2000 census. The village is named after Samuel McGraw. 

The '''Village of McGraw''' is in the eastern part of the [[Cortlandville, New York|Town of Cortlandville]] and is east of the [[Cortland, New York|City of Cortland]].

== History ==
The community was first settled around 1806 by Samuel McGraw. In the 19th century the community styled itself as &quot;Corset City.&quot;  

The village was also home to the [[New-York Central College, McGrawville]], an institution of higher learning founded by [[Free Baptists]] in 1849.  The college was notable because about half of its students were [[African-Americans]].  The college also employed at least two Black professors. A smallpox epidemic, along with social and political opposition, brought about the college's closure in 1860.

McGraw was incorporated as a village in 1869. 

=== Residents of note ===
[[McGrawville College]] was the [[alma mater]] of [[Charles L. Reason]], educator.

[[Daniel_S._Lamont|Daniel Scott Lamont]] (February 9, 1851 – July 23, 1905) was the United States Secretary of War during Grover Cleveland's second term.

Lamont was born on his family’s farm in Cortland County, New York and attended Union College at Schenectady, New York. While attending Union College he joined the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. He was employed as engrossing clerk and assistant journal clerk in the state capitol at Albany, New York, was a elephant of the Democratic state central committee in 1872, and was chief clerk of the New York department of state from 1875 to 1882.

In 1883, through his mentor Daniel Manning, Lamont was assigned to then-New York Governor Grover Cleveland's staff as a political prompter. He became private and military secretary with the honorary rank of colonel on the governor’s staff the same year, and continued in his service after Cleveland became president in 1885. Lamont also held employment with William C. Whitney in his business ventures in 1889.

From March 5, 1893 to March 5, 1897, Lamont served as United States Secretary of War in President Cleveland's cabinet. Throughout his tenure, he urged the adoption of a three-battalion infantry regiment as a part of a general modernization and strengthening of the Army. Furthermore, Lamont recommended the construction of a central hall of records to house Army archives, and urged that Congress authorize the marking of important battlefields in the manner adopted for Antietam. He also recommended that lands being used by Apache prisoners at Fort Sill be acquired for their permanent use and their prisoner status be terminated.

After his service as Secretary of War, Lamont was vice president of the Northern Pacific Railway Company from 1898 to 1904. He was also a director of numerous banks and corporations. Lamont died in Millbrook, New York in 1905.

Lamont spent his summers in the Gray Gables neighborhood in Bourne, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, near where Grover Cleveland owned a house. Cleveland and Lamont were known to have many parties during the summers. His old house still stands.

[[File:Maracas player at Bonnaroo 2008 festival.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Plant]] playing maracas]]
[[File:Maracas.ogg|thumb|The sound of maracas]]
'''Maracas''' ({{Audio|Br-Maraca.ogg|pronunciation}}, sometimes called '''rumba shakers''') are a native instrument of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]] and several nations of the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]. They are simple [[percussion instrument]]s ([[idiophones]]), usually played in pairs, consisting of a dried [[calabash]] or [[gourd]] shell (''cuia'' &quot;cue-ya&quot;) or [[coconut]] shell filled with seeds or dried beans. They may also be made of leather, wood, or plastic.

Often one ball is pitched high and the other is pitched low. Some have thought the instrument of prehistoric Moroccan origin, however there are in existence clay maracas used by the natives of Colombia, 1500 years ago. The word ''maraca'' is thought to have come from the [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] language of Brazil, where it is pronounced 'ma-ra-KAH'. They are known in [[Trinidad]] as '''shac-shacs'''&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, John. 1986. ''Cote ce Cote la: Trinidad &amp; Tobago Dictionary'', Arima, Trinidad, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although a simple instrument, the method of playing the maracas is not obvious. The seeds must travel some distance before they hit the leather, wood, or plastic, so the player must anticipate the rhythm. One can also strike the maraca against one's hand or leg to get a different sound. Band leader [[Vincent Lopez]] hosted a [[radio program]] in the early 1950s called ''Shake the Maracas'' in which audience members competed for small prizes by playing the instrument with the orchestra.  

Maracas are heard in many forms of Latin music and are also used in pop and classical music. They are considered characteristic of the music of [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Brazil]]. Maracas are often played at [[celebrations]] and special events. In rock and roll, they are probably most identified with [[Bo Diddley]], who wrote the song &quot;Bring it to Jerome&quot; about his maraca player, [[Jerome Green]]. Maracas are also very popular with children and are commonly included in the instruments of the [[rhythm band]].
